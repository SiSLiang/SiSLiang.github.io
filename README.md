## Project
### Multi Factor Investment Portfolio
[Publication](https://github.com/JohananAntonPranesh/MultiFactor)

An adaptive investment model that dynamically reallocates portfolio weights using a factor framework to minimize downside volatility. The objective is to enhance the performance of existing portfolios by rebalancing toward targeted factor exposures. Using a structured multifactor framework, we minimize downside volatility and consequentially improve risk-adjusted returns while preserving core asset exposure.

### Machine Learning Bitcoin Trading Strategy - Interpretability
[Publication](https://sites.google.com/lehigh.edu/machinelearningresearch/home)

Our project aims to assess the effectiveness of applying an existing Bitcoin trading strategy to the stock market. By adapting the strategy developed for Bitcoin trading and applying it to stock trading, we seek to evaluate its efficiency. The interpretability analysis will provide insights into the potential cross-market applicability of the strategy. By leveraging historical Bitcoin data together with other stock data, our team is testing different models to demystify the decision-making process of these models, fostering transparency, trust, and empowering traders to make informed decisions in the world of trading. It is essential to ensure that the decisions made by the model align with human intuition and can be trusted.
